# Deep-Learning-NNs
Deep learning stuff using Neural Networks.


All neural network implementations in this repository are Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs) implemented using Keras.


CNN.ipynb ia an image classification neural network used on the cat-dog dataset from kaggle.


cnn6 and cnn7 are CNNs for Mini-Imagenet and fruits-360, flowers and chest x-ray are kaggle datasets which are classified with a constraint of 90% accuracy.
