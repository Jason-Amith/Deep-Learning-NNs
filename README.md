# Deep-Learning-NNs
Deep learning stuff using Neural Networks./n
All neural network implementations in this repository are Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs) implemented with Keras.
cnn6 and cnn7 are CNNs for Mini-Imagenet
fruits-360, flowers and chest x-ray are kaggle datasets which are classified with a constraint of 90% accuracy.
